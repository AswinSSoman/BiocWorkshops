Last modified: 22 May, 2018. 1.1 For Everyone This book contains workshops used in R / Bioconductor training. The workshops are divided into 3 sections: Learn (100-series chapters) contains material for beginning users of R and Bioconductor. The Bioconductor-related material is relevant even for experienced R users who are new to Bioconductor. Use (200-series chapters) contains workshops emphasizing use of Bioconductor for common tasks, e.g., bulk RNA-seq differential expression, ChIP-seq, single-cell analysis, gene set enrichment, and annotation. Develop (500-series chapters) contains workshops to help expert users hone their skills and contribute their domain-specific knowledge to the Bioconductor community. 1.2 For Workshop Authors To contribute a new workshop, open a BiocWorkshops issue asking to be added as a collaborator. Write your workshop as a stand-alone markdown document, using the _template.Rmd file as a starting point. Follow the numbering scheme for classifying your workshop. Also update the DESCRIPTION file adding packages utilized in your workshop to the Imports field. Please be kind and don’t remove anyone elses packages from the DESCRIPTION as this is a shared file for all workshops. See bookdown instructions for authoring documents; we are using the ‘knit-then-merge’ strategy. You’ll need to install the bookdown package package from CRAN, as well as pandoc. Render your chapter with the preview= option to render_book(), e.g., Rscript -e &quot;bookdown::render_book( \\ &#39;xxx_Your_Workshop.Rmd&#39;, &#39;bookdown::gitbook&#39;, preview=TRUE \\ )&quot; As this is a shared space for all workshop contributors, in order to use the above command in the BiocWorkshops directory, the index has to be built at least once, which can be time consuming depending on how many workshops have already been submitted. Rscript -e &quot;bookdown::render_book( \\ &#39;index.Rmd&#39;, &#39;bookdown::gitbook&#39;)&quot; To avoid having to build all workshops but still be able to preview your individual workshop we recommend creating a soft link to your .Rmd file. We recommend having the file in the BiocWorkshop/ and the soft link in any other directory on your system. By default, this will generate an html file in _book/ wherever this command is run. mkdir tmp cd tmp/ ln -s ../xxx_Your_Workshop.Rmd Rscript -e &quot;bookdown::render_book( \\ &#39;xxx_Your_Workshop.Rmd&#39;, &#39;bookdown::gitbook&#39;, preview=TRUE \\ )&quot; Push only your .Rmd file to the BiocWorkshop repository; the book will be rebuilt manually or automatically. Eventually the output will be available for end-users at https://bioconductor.github.io/BiocWorkshops .The master branch will not contain the built version of the book. Switching to the gh-pages branch will show built output. 1.3 Deadlines for Bioc2018 Please be aware of the following deadlines for the Bioconductor 2018 Conference in Toronto Fri June 29: draft workshop materials submitted to this Bioconductor GitHub bookdown site Fri July 6: feedback period completes Weds July 18: workshops must pass checks without errors or warnings (All materials will be checked by Continuous Integration) Thurs / Fri July 26-27: Bioc2018 Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, NY↩ "],

It is intended for package developers who want to learn how to use the DelayedArray framework to support the analysis of large datasets, particularly through the use of on-disk data storage. The first part of the workshop will provide an overview of the DelayedArray infrastructure and introduce computing on DelayedArray objects using delayed operations and block-processing. The second part of the workshop will present strategies for adding support for DelayedArray to an existing package and extending the DelayedArray framework. Students can expect a mixture of lecture and question-and-answer session to teach the fundamental concepts. There will be plenty of examples to illustrate common design patterns for writing performant code, although we will not be writing much code during the workshop. 6.2.1 Pre-requisites Solid understanding of R Familiarity with common operations on arrays (e.g., colSums() and those available in the matrixStats package) Familiarity with object oriented programming, particularly S4, will be useful but is not essential No familiarity required of technical details of particular data storage backends (e.g., HDF5, sparse matrices) No familiarity required of particular biological techniques (e.g., single-cell RNA-seq) 6.2.2 Workshop Participation Questions and discussion are encouraged! This will be especially important to guide the second half of the worshop which focuses on integrating DelayedArray into an existing or new Bioconductor package. Students will be expected to be able to follow and reason about example R code. 6.2.3 R / Bioconductor packages used DelayedArray HDF5Array SummarizedExperiment DelayedMatrixStats beachmat 6.2.4 Time outline Activity Time Introductory slides 15m Part 1: Overview of DelayedArray framework 45m Part 2: Incoporating DelayedArray into a package 45m Questions and discussion 15m 6.3 Workshop goals and objectives 6.3.1 Learning goals Identify when it is useful to use a DelayedArray instead of an ordinary array or other array-like data structure. Become familiar with the fundamental concepts of delayed operations, block-processing, and realization. Learn of existing functions and packages for constructing and computing on DelayedArray objects, avoiding the need to re-invent the wheel. Learn common design patterns for writing performant code that operates on a DelayedArray. Evaluate whether an existing function that operates on an ordinary array can be readily adapted to work on a DelayedArray. Reason about potential bottlenecks in algorithms operating on DelayedArray objects. 6.3.2 Learning objectives Understand the differences between a DelayedArray instance and an instance of a subclass (e.g., HDF5Array, RleArray). Know what types of operations ‘degrade’ an instance of a DelayedArray subclass to a DelayedArray, as well as when and why this matters. Construct a DelayedArray: From an in-memory array-like object. From an on-disk data store (e.g., HDF5). From scratch by writing data to a RealizationSink. Take a function that operates on rows or columns of a matrix and apply it to a DelayedMatrix. Use block-processing on a DelayedArray to compute: A univariate (scalar) summary statistic (e.g., max()). A multivariate (vector) summary statistic (e.g., colSum() or rowMean()). A multivariate (array-like) summary statistic (e.g., rowRanks()). Design an algorithm that imports data into a DelayedArray. "],

This can be as simple as mapping Ensembl IDs to corresponding HUGO gene symbols, to much more complex queries involving multiple data sources. In this workshop we will cover the various classes of annotation packages, what they contain, and how to use them efficiently. 12.2.1 Prerequisites Basic knowledge of R syntax Basic understanding of the various annotation sources (NCBI, EBI/EMBL) Useful background reading The AnnotationDbi vignette.

For any high-throughput experiment the analyst usually starts with a set of identifiers for each thing that was measured, and in order to make the results useful to collaborators these identifiers need to be mapped to other identifiers that are either more familiar to collaborators, or that can be used for further analyses.

In particular, we will focus on biomarker discovery from pharmacogenomic data, which consists of developing predictors of response of cancer cell lines to chemical compounds based on their genomic features. From a methodological viewpoint, biomarker discovery is strongly linked to variable selection, through methods such as Supervised Learning with sparsity inducing norms (e.g., ElasticNet) or techniques accounting for the complex correlation structure of biological features (e.g., mRMR). Yet, the main focus of this talk will be on sound use of such methods in a pharmacogenomics context, their validation and correct interpretation of the produced results. We will discuss how to assess the quality of both the input and output data. We will illustrate the importance of unified analytical platforms, data and code sharing in bioinformatics and biomedical research, as the data generation process becomes increasingly complex and requires high level of replication to achieve robust results. This is particularly relevant as our portfolio of machine learning techniques is ever enlarging, with its set of hyperparameters that can be tuning in a multitude of ways, increasing the risk of overfitting when developing multivariate predictors of drug response. 14.2.1 Pre-requisites Basic knowledge of R syntax Familiarity with the machine learning concept and at least a few approaches Following resources might be useful to read: https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/btv723 https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/46/D1/D994/4372597 https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf 14.2.2 Workshop Participation Participants expected to have the following required packages installed on their machines to be able to run the commands along with the instructors. * PharmacoGx and Biobase from Bioconductor * mRMRe, caret, glmnet, randomForest from cran * bhklab/mci and bhklab/PharmacoGx-ML from github 14.2.3 R / Bioconductor packages used https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/PharmacoGx.html 14.2.4 Time outline An example for a 45-minute workshop: Activity Time Introduction 10m Basic functionalities of PharmacoGx 15m Consistency assessment between datasets 15m Machine learning and biomarker discovery 20m 14.3 Workshop goals and objectives 14.3.1 Learning goals describe the pharmacogenomic datasets and their usefulness learn how to extract information from these datasets and to intersect them over their common features identify functionalities available in PharmacoGx package to work with the high dimensional pharmacogenomics data assess reproducibility and replication of pharmacogenomics studies understand how to handle the biomarker discovery as a pattern recognition problem in the domain of pharmacogenomics studies 14.3.2 Learning objectives list available standardized pharmacogenomic datasets and download them understand the structure of these darasest and how to access the features and response quantifications create drug-dose response plots Measure the consistency across multiple datasets and how to improve such measurements Assess whether known biomarkers are reproduced within these datasets Predict new biomarkers by applying different machine learning methods "],
