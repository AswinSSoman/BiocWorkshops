Last modified: 22 May, 2018. 1.1 For Everyone This book contains workshops used in R / Bioconductor training. The workshops are divided into 3 sections: Learn (100-series chapters) contains material for beginning users of R and Bioconductor. The Bioconductor-related material is relevant even for experienced R users who are new to Bioconductor. Use (200-series chapters) contains workshops emphasizing use of Bioconductor for common tasks, e.g., bulk RNA-seq differential expression, ChIP-seq, single-cell analysis, gene set enrichment, and annotation. Develop (500-series chapters) contains workshops to help expert users hone their skills and contribute their domain-specific knowledge to the Bioconductor community. 1.2 For Workshop Authors To contribute a new workshop, open a BiocWorkshops issue asking to be added as a collaborator. Write your workshop as a stand-alone markdown document, using the _template.Rmd file as a starting point. Follow the numbering scheme for classifying your workshop. Also update the DESCRIPTION file adding packages utilized in your workshop to the Imports field. Please be kind and don’t remove anyone elses packages from the DESCRIPTION as this is a shared file for all workshops. See bookdown instructions for authoring documents; we are using the ‘knit-then-merge’ strategy. You’ll need to install the bookdown package package from CRAN, as well as pandoc. Render your chapter with the preview= option to render_book(), e.g., Rscript -e &quot;bookdown::render_book( \\ &#39;xxx_Your_Workshop.Rmd&#39;, &#39;bookdown::gitbook&#39;, preview=TRUE \\ )&quot; As this is a shared space for all workshop contributors, in order to use the above command in the BiocWorkshops directory, the index has to be built at least once, which can be time consuming depending on how many workshops have already been submitted. Rscript -e &quot;bookdown::render_book( \\ &#39;index.Rmd&#39;, &#39;bookdown::gitbook&#39;)&quot; To avoid having to build all workshops but still be able to preview your individual workshop we recommend creating a soft link to your .Rmd file. We recommend having the file in the BiocWorkshop/ and the soft link in any other directory on your system. By default, this will generate an html file in _book/ wherever this command is run. mkdir tmp cd tmp/ ln -s ../xxx_Your_Workshop.Rmd Rscript -e &quot;bookdown::render_book( \\ &#39;xxx_Your_Workshop.Rmd&#39;, &#39;bookdown::gitbook&#39;, preview=TRUE \\ )&quot; Push only your .Rmd file to the BiocWorkshop repository; the book will be rebuilt manually or automatically. Eventually the output will be available for end-users at https://bioconductor.github.io/BiocWorkshops .The master branch will not contain the built version of the book. Switching to the gh-pages branch will show built output. 1.3 Deadlines for Bioc2018 Please be aware of the following deadlines for the Bioconductor 2018 Conference in Toronto Fri June 29: draft workshop materials submitted to this Bioconductor GitHub bookdown site Fri July 6: feedback period completes Weds July 18: workshops must pass checks without errors or warnings (All materials will be checked by Continuous Integration) Thurs / Fri July 26-27: Bioc2018 Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, NY↩ "]
