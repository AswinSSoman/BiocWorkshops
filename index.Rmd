## For Everyone

This book contains workshops used in _R_ / _Bioconductor_
training. The workshops are divided into 3 sections:

- **Learn** (100-series chapters) contains material for beginning
  users of _R_ and _Bioconductor_. The _Bioconductor_-related material
  is relevant even for experienced _R_ users who are new to
  _Bioconductor_.
  
- **Use** (200-series chapters) contains workshops emphasizing use of
  _Bioconductor_ for common tasks, e.g., bulk RNA-seq differential
  expression, ChIP-seq, single-cell analysis, gene set enrichment, and
  annotation.

- **Develop** (500-series chapters) contains workshops to help expert
  users hone their skills and contribute their domain-specific
  knowledge to the _Bioconductor_ community.
  
## For Workshop Authors

To contribute a new workshop, open a [BiocWorkshops issue][] asking to
be added as a collaborator.

Write your workshop as a stand-alone markdown document, using the
[_template.Rmd][] file as a starting point. Follow the numbering
scheme for classifying your workshop. 

See [bookdown][] instructions for authoring documents; we are using
the 'knit-then-merge' strategy. You'll need to install the
[bookdown package][] package from CRAN, as well as [pandoc][]. Render
your chapter with the `preview=` option to `render_book()`, e.g.,

```
Rscript -e "bookdown::render_book(                             \
    'xxx_Your_Workshop.Rmd', 'bookdown::gitbook', preview=TRUE \
)"
```

Push **only** your .Rmd file to the repository; the book will be
rebuilt manually or automatically. Eventually the output will be
available for end-users at https://bioconductor.github.io/BiocWorkshops
