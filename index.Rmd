Welcome to Bioc2018. This year's conference includes a wide array of workshops for audiences ranging from beginner to advance users and developers. Workshop materials are available as a book in html, pdf, and eBook format at https://bioconductor.github.io/BiocWorkshops/. Workshops are organized by level and topic according to numbers, as described below. Every workshop starts with a syllabus that will help you to decide whether it matches your learning goals. 

## The Workshops

This book contains workshops for _R_ / _Bioconductor_
training. The workshops are divided into 3 sections:

- **Learn** (100-series chapters) contains material for beginning
  users of _R_ and _Bioconductor_. However, even experienced _R_ and _Bioconductor_ 
  users may find something new here. 
    - 100: _R_ and _Bioconductor_ for everyone: an introduction
    - 101: Introduction to Bioconductor annotation resources
    - 102: Solving common bioinformatic challenges using GenomicRanges
    - 103: Public data resources and Bioconductor

- **Use** (200-series chapters) contains workshops emphasizing use of
  _Bioconductor_ for common tasks, e.g., RNA-seq differential
  expression, single-cell analysis, gene set enrichment, multi'omics analysis, 
  genome analysis, network analysis, and pharmacogenomics.
    - 200: RNA-seq analysis is easy as 1-2-3 with limma, Glimma and edgeR
    - 201: RNA-seq data analysis with DESeq2
    - 202: Analysis of single-cell RNA-seq data: Dimensionality reduction, clustering, and lineage inference
    - 210: Functional enrichment analysis of high-throughput omics data
    - 220: Workflow for multi-omics analysis with MultiAssayExperiment
    - 230: Cytoscape automation in R using Rcy3
    - 240: Fluent genomic data analysis with plyranges
    - 250: Working with genomic data in R with the DECIPHER package
    - 260: Biomarker discovery from large pharmacogenomics datasets
    
- **Develop** (500-series chapters) contains workshops to help expert
  users hone their skills and contribute their domain-specific
  knowledge to the _Bioconductor_ community. These workshops are presented
  on "Developer Day". 
    - 500: Effectively using the DelayedArray framework to support the analysis of large datasets
    - 510: Maintaining your Bioconductor package
