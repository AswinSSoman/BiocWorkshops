Last modified: 14 May, 2018. 1.1 For Everyone This book contains workshops used in R / Bioconductor training. The workshops are divided into 3 sections: Learn (100-series chapters) contains material for beginning users of R and Bioconductor. The Bioconductor-related material is relevant even for experienced R users who are new to Bioconductor. Use (200-series chapters) contains workshops emphasizing use of Bioconductor for common tasks, e.g., bulk RNA-seq differential expression, ChIP-seq, single-cell analysis, gene set enrichment, and annotation. Develop (500-series chapters) contains workshops to help expert users hone their skills and contribute their domain-specific knowledge to the Bioconductor community. 1.2 For Workshop Authors To contribute a new workshop, open a BiocWorkshops issue asking to be added as a collaborator. Write your workshop as a stand-alone markdown document, using the _template.Rmd file as a starting point. Follow the numbering scheme for classifying your workshop. See bookdown instructions for authoring documents; we are using the ‘knit-then-merge’ strategy. You’ll need to install the bookdown package package from CRAN, as well as pandoc. Render your chapter with the preview= option to render_book(), e.g., Rscript -e &quot;bookdown::render_book( \\ &#39;xxx_Your_Workshop.Rmd&#39;, &#39;bookdown::gitbook&#39;, preview=TRUE \\ )&quot; Push only your .Rmd file to the repository; the book will be rebuilt manually or automatically. Eventually the output will be availble for end-users at https://bioconductor.github.io/BiocWorkshops Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center, Buffalo, NY↩ "]
